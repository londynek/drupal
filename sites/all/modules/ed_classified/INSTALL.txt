Classified Ads module installation instructions

=== Installation ===

1) Copy this directory to a suitable modules directory, such as 
   sites/all/modules

2) Enable the module at: Administer > Site building > Modules. This will
   create the necessary tables and taxonomy

3) Configure the module settings at: Administer > Site configuration >
   Classified Ads.  You should decide on an expiration and purge policy,
   as well as a max body length (in characters).

4) IMPORTANT: Add terms to the taxonomy that has been created during the
   installation.  The taxonomy name is called 'Classified Ads' by default,
   and you should add some terms before you allow any classified ads to
   be created.

   For example, you might want to create a simple taxonomy structure like:

    - Buy
    - Sell
    - Trade

   etc.  Be sure to set desired options for the taxonomy - like
   single/multiple select, hierarchy options, etc.  The taxonomy should
   have been configured to work with the ed_classified content type.
   I've used various taxonomy schemes, and I will be providing handbook
   entries that describe how to use taxonomies to manage classified ads.

   Note: do not delete this taxonomy vocabulary - it's 'owned' by the
   ed_classified module, and is required for proper functioning.

5) Now, visit admin/user/access and set the desired access permissions.
   For example, allow authenticated users access to 'create classified
   ads' and 'edit own classified ads', etc.

6) Visit admin/build/block and enable the classified ads blocks you
   want to display.  Please note that the popular ads block requires
   access log features enabled (if you haven't enabled access logging in
   admin/logs/settings (enable 'Count content views' and 'Enable access
   log' settings.)

   Authorized users may now add classified ads.
